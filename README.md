Originally, the AI picks mostly random moves and is not able to switch pokemon or use moves in a smart way. Here the AI is switching to and from a Pokemon while losing the type advantage. This is not good behavior in a battle.

Final Battle

We can see in the final trained agent that the AI has now learned to pick moves that are super effective against the pokemon its battling against. In fact, the evaluation for one of the agents shows a 100% win rate against a random agent, and a 90% win rate against the max damage agent!
